# NFT Collection Project

To build the smart contract we would be using Hardhat. Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment and framework designed for full stack development in Solidity. In simple words you can write your smart contract, deploy them, run tests, and debug your code.

To setup a Hardhat project, Open up a terminal and execute these commands

```shell
mkdir NFT-Collection
cd NFT-Collection
mkdir hardhat-tutorial
cd hardhat-tutorial
npm init --yes
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

To setup a Hardhat project, Open up a terminal and execute these commands
```
npx hardhat
```
Make sure you select Create a Javascript Project and then follow the steps in the terminal to complete your Hardhat setup.

In the same terminal now install @openzeppelin/contracts as we would be importing Openzeppelin's ERC721Enumerable Contract in our CryptoDevs contract.
```
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
```
